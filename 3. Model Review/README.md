### Temporal Fusion Transformers
for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting
   
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09363.pdf
- Abstract
    - introduce Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
        - a novel attention-based architecture 
    - TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies
    - TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components
- Keywords
    - Deep Learning, Time Series, Attention mechanisms
