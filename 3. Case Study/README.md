    - including several special cases (normal, Birnbaum-Sanuders, Student's , Laplace distribution)
    - implementing using Monte Carlo simulation 
- Abstract
    - skew-normal distribution by Azzalini
        -  extension of the normal distribution 
    - alpha-skew-normal distribution by Elal-Olivero
        - first defined a new bimodal-symmetric normal distribution with probability density function
        - presents its stochastic representation 


### Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE): A Novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Model for Personalized Recommendations
   
- Keywords
    - Multi-task Learning, Recommender System, Seesaw Phenomenon

- Abstract
    - Multi-task learning(MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications
    - often suffer from performance degeneration with
        - **negative transfer** due to the complex and  competing task correlation in real-world recommender system.
        - **seesaw phenomenon** that performance of one task is often improved by hurting the performance of some other tasks.
    - To address these issues, propose a **Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) model** with a novel sharing structure design.
    - PLE
        - seperates shared components and task-specific components explicitly
        - adopts a progressive routing mechanism to extract and seperate deeper semantic knowledge gradually
        - improving efficiency of joint representation learning and information routing across tasks in a general setup.
    - experiments
        - dataset : Tencent video recommendation dataset with 1 billion sample(real-world data)
        - apply PLE to
            - complicated correlated tasks
                - two-task cases
                - multi-task cases
            - normally correlated tasks
                - two-task cases
                - multi-task cases
        - results
            - PLE outperforms SOTA MTL models significantly under different task correlations and task-group size.
            - online evaluation of PLE on a large-scale content recommendation platform at Tencent manifests 2.23% increase in view-count, 1.84% increase in watch time compared to SOTA MTL models
            - offline experiments on publick benchmark datasets
                - PLE can be applied to a variety of scenarios besides recommendation to eliminate the seesaw phenomenon.
    - PLE now has been deployed to the online video recommender system in Tencent successfully.
  
  
### Dynamic Pricing in Spatial Crowdsourcing: A Matching-Based Approch

- [Dynamic Pricing in Spatial Crowdsourcing: A Matching-Based Approch](https://zhouzimu.github.io/paper/sigmod18-tong.pdf)
- Keywords 
    - Spatial Crowdsourcing; Pricing Strategy
- Abstract
    - The spatial crowdsourcing platform prices tasks according to the demand and the supply in the crowdsourcing market to maximize its total revenue.
    - Spatial crowdsourcing needs to dynamically price for multiple local markets fragmented by the spatiotemporal distributions of tasks and workers and the mobility of workers
    - Define GDP(Global Dynamic Pricing) problem in spatial crowdsourcing.
    - purpose a Matching-based Pricing Strategy(MAPS)
